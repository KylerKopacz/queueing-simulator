# Queueing Simulator
A queueing simulator written in Java, made to explore how variability affects a single-server queueing system.

The code and write-up for this project was written by Kyler Kopacz (Amherst Class of 2021) and Connor Haugh (Amherst Class of 2021).

## Question of Interest:
How does job size variability affect mean response time in a single-server queueing system?

## TODO List:
- [X] - Create Exponential Distribution that creates whole numbers
- [X] - Create Hyperexponentail Distribution that creates whole numbers
- [] - Create the calculation for E[X], E[X^2], and Var[X]
- [] - Create the actual simulation
- [] - After the simulation is finished, modify to make it 2 server
