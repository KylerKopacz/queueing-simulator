## Queueing Simulator
A queueing simulator written in Java, made to explore how variability affects a single-server queueing system.

The code and write-up for this project was written by Kyler Kopacz (Amherst Class of 2021) and Connor Haugh (Amherst Class of 2021).

## How to Run
Compile using a JDK command to compile all java files in the folder. Keep in mind that the majority of this project was written in JDK 11.
```
javac *.java
```
To view the tests we used to create our writeup, simply run TestEnviroment.java with the java TestEnviroment command in your terminal.
```
java TestEnvironment
```

All documentation is in JavaDocs. To open the documentation, open the 'index.html' on your browser. You can then navigate all of the code documentation for the simulator.
