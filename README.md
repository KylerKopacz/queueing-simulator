# Queueing Simulator
A queueing simulator written in Java, made to explore how variability affects a single-server queueing system.

The code and write-up for this project was written by Kyler Kopacz (Amherst Class of 2021) and Connor Haugh (Amherst Class of 2021).

## Question of Interest:
How does job size variability affect mean response time in a single-server queueing system?

## TODO List:
- [] - Create a Queue Data Structure
- [] - Create timing scheme for event drive queue
