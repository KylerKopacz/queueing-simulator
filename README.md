## Queueing Simulator
A queueing simulator written in Java, made to explore how variability affects a single-server queueing system.

The code and write-up for this project was written by Kyler Kopacz (Amherst Class of 2021) and Connor Haugh (Amherst Class of 2021).

## How to Run
Compile using a JDK command to compile all java files in the folder. To view the tests we used to create our writeup, simply run TestEnviroment.java with the java TestEnviroment command in your terminal.
All documentation is in JavaDocs.
